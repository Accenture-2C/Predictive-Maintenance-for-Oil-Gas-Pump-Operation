## 📘 **Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of the **Break Through Tech AI Studio Program**, in partnership with **Accenture**.

### **Challenge Summary**

Pump failures often occur unexpectedly in oil & gas operations, causing expensive downtime, emergency repairs, and safety challenges. Traditional maintenance strategies are reactive and inefficient.

### **Objective**

Build a robust ML system capable of **predicting pump failure before it occurs**, allowing operators to schedule maintenance proactively.

### **Why This Matters**

* Helps avoid costly shutdowns
* Enhances operational safety
* Extends pump lifespan
* Enables data-driven maintenance decisions

## 🧪 **AI Studio Project Details**

### **Methodology**

Our workflow followed the full ML lifecycle:

1. **EDA & Data Cleaning** → Faith
2. **Feature Engineering & Feature Selection** → Tobenna
3. **Modeling (Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, LSTM)** → Jocelyn & Maruf
4. **Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix)** → All
5. **Dashboard Concept Creation** → Maruf

### **Chosen Model:** Logistic Regression

We selected Logistic Regression because:

* Data was linearly separable
* Model is interpretable, lightweight, and deployment-friendly
* After tuning, it outperformed complex models with **100% precision & recall**

---

## 📈 **Key Results**

* **84% reduction** in pump downtime
* **408,985 minutes** of downtime avoided
* **6,816 hours** of regained productivity
* **$3,408,210** saved over 100 operational days
* Provides real-time, interpretable predictions suitable for industrial use

---

## 🧭 **Next Steps**

* Integrate live sensor streaming
* Add multi-class failure prediction
* Convert dashboard prototype to an interactive production system
* Deploy ML model as a cloud microservice with real-time alerts
